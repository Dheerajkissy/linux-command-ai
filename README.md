# AI-Based Linux Command Recommendation System

## 📌 Overview
This project is an AI-based system that recommends appropriate Linux commands based on natural language task descriptions.  
It uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and classical Machine Learning techniques to map user queries to relevant Linux commands.

The system is **safe by design** — it only recommends commands and does not execute them.
